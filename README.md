# Description

This is an experimental signaling server to explore how [hole punching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)>) would work in a peer-to-peer network.

In a peer-to-peer network that utilizes hole punching, the nodes (or clients) will first communicate with a signaling server in order to establish a direct connection with each other. The signaling server acts as a facilitator, allowing nodes to discover each other and initiate the hole punching process.

This code is experiemental and should not be used in production.
